# NYC Taxi Trip EDA

## Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on NYC Taxi trip data. It involves data loading, cleaning, visualization, and geospatial analysis to extract insights about trip patterns, revenue trends, and taxi zone distribution.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and handling missing values.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Analyzing trip duration, fare distribution, and passenger count.
- **Time-based Analysis**: Understanding hourly, daily, and monthly trip trends.
- **Revenue Trends**: Identifying seasonal revenue patterns.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Mapping trips per zone using NYC Taxi Zones shapefile.
